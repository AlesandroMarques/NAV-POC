    <p>Arcserve Replication and High Availability (RHA) ensures business continuity for applications and systems with proven technologies that have one common purpose:

        for discrete replication programs focused on specific applications and systems. Arcserve Replication and High Availability synchronizes the data on Windows 
        and Linux systems with a second physical or virtual system provisioned locally, at a remote location, or in the cloud. Once synchronized, byte-level changes 
        are continuously replicated from the production system to the replica system, providing constant protection to keep data and information accurate, and systems operational</p>
