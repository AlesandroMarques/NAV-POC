    <h4>Networking</h4>
    <p>With the explosion of employees bringing their own devices to the office, you can see 
        the benefits of implementing wireless and wired networks into your organization. 
        To maintain productivity, it is important for employees to have access to the corporate 
        network by giving them wireless access from their own devices.</p>

    <p>Duologik effectively maintains and monitors your network performance, checking for 
        security breaches and poor data management practices for both physical and virtual environments.</p>    

    <h6>Enable Employee Devices</h6>    
    <p>Enabling workers to use their own mobile devices cause headaches for the IT department from a security 
        point of view. The threat of malware getting onto the corporate network through a compromised device 
        is a particular issue. If the mobile or tablet is owned by the business, security is easier to control. 
        But, are employee-owned devices protected? The answer is no.</p>
    <h6>Reduce Performance Bottlenecks</h6>
    <p>Enterprise mobility to the convergence of voice, video, data to cloud computing adds to its already 
        heavy workload with the added pressure of balancing cost and performance.  Providing a consistently 
        excellent end-user experience on a myriad of devices, across many different networks, and on applications 
        that are everywhere is the new performance paradigm. Do you know what traffic is running across your network? 
        How do you improve the network performance?</p>

    <h6>Improve Policy and Best Practice</h6>    
    <p>Duologik will implement an automated network improvement process that addresses your highest business priorities 
        and operational risks. Our analytics process will provide you with the information to manage and track improvements 
        across hardware, software, security, and system log data.</p>
