    <h4>VIRTUALIZATION & STORAGE</h4>
    <p>Duologik offers server virtualization and shared storage 
        solutions that put your organization in an ideal position 
        for future growth. Server virtualization prevents server sprawl, 
        leading to poor hardware resource utilization, possible breach in 
        software security and high electricity and cooling costs.  Stop technology wastage
        , increase your availability and manage your cost.</p>
    <h6>Duologik Virtualization Services</h6>
    <p>Duologik works with VMware and Microsoft products in multiple editions.  
        Both companies provide a free edition of their respective hypervisor 
        tools for customers who do not have advanced virtualization needs.</p>
        
        <h6>How can Duologik help?</h6>
    <p>Duologik certified experts will virtualize your companyâ€™s servers starting with an analysis 
        of your current IT environment. Whether it is new implementation or an update to your 
        current environment, you can take advantage of our virtualization capabilities to make it happen.
        Starting with a technical assessment, our Statement of Work (SoW) contains appropriate technical 
        recommendations and action items. You can expect an architecture update, implementation details 
        with priorities, ongoing support and responsibilities, flexible pricing options and ROI.
